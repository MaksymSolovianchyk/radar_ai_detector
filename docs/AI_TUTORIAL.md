## Deployment Tutorial
<a id="deployment-tutorial"></a>
### To compile the image_classification project
Can be used as first step if you want to compile standard code from STM or as last one if using custom model!
1.	Software requirements:
<a id="software-requirements"></a>
The following software tools are required:
	•	STEdgeAI Core - Used to convert a trained .tflite or .onnx AI model into optimized C code for STM32 microcontrollers.
	•	STM32CubeIDE - Used to build the embedded C project and flash the firmware to the STM32 board.
	•	Python 3.x - Required to run the STM32 AI Model Zoo Services scripts.

2.	 Repository Setup
<a id="repository-setup"></a>
Clone the following two repositories:
	•	stm32ai-modelzoo
	•	stm32ai-modelzoo-services
After cloning, navigate to the services repository:
```
cd stm32ai-modelzoo-services
```
3.	Install Python Dependencies (MacOS)
<a id="install-python-dependencies-macos"></a>
 ```terminal
brew install python@3.11                  
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11 -m venv st_zoo311
source st_zoo311/bin/activate
python --version   # should show 3.11.x
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install "tensorflow==2.18.0"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.	(Optional) NVIDIA GPU Setup with Conda
<a id="optional-nvidia-gpu-setup-with-conda"></a>
If using an NVIDIA GPU and Conda, install CUDA dependencies:
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.8 cudnn

mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/' > $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
```
5.	Navigate to the Desired Project
`cd image_classification`

Open deployment_n6_config.yaml and modify it according to the example below. Verify model_path with desired model that you want to deploy (in model-zoo directory), path_to_stdegai and path_to_cubeIDE must be changed according to your file location. In case you have STM AI studio, you can find paths there in settings (Windows).

```yaml
model:
  # path to a `.tflite` or `.onnx` file.
  model_path: ../../stm32ai-modelzoo/image_classification/mobilenetv2/ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset/tf_flowers/mobilenetv2_a035_128_fft/mobilenetv2_a035_128_fft_int8.tflite
operation_mode: deployment
dataset:
  dataset_name: tf_flowers
  class_names: [daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips]
  classes_file_path: ./datasets/labels_tf_flowers.txt

preprocessing:
  resizing:
    interpolation: bilinear
    aspect_ratio: crop
  color_mode: rgb # rgb, bgr

tools:
  stedgeai:
    optimization: balanced
    on_cloud: False
    path_to_stedgeai: /Applications/ST/STEdgeAI/3.0/Utilities/mac/stedgeai
  path_to_cubeIDE: /Applications/STM32CubeIDE.app/Contents/MacOS/STM32CubeIDE

deployment:
  c_project_path: ../application_code/image_classification/STM32N6/
  IDE: GCC
  verbosity: 1
  hardware_setup:
    serie: STM32N6
    board: STM32N6570-DK

hydra:
  run:
    dir: ./tf/src/experiments_outputs/${now:%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S}

mlflow:
  uri: ./tf/src/experiments_outputs/mlruns
```

6.	Connect board to the PC and then the python script has to be compiled via terminal using command:
```
python3 stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name deployment_n6_config.yaml
```
In case of any errors related to 'Set the environment variable HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 for a complete stack trace.' (fix for MacOS)
```
export PATH="/Applications/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer/STM32CubeProgrammer.app/Contents/MacOs/bin:$PATH"
hash -r
export PATH="/Applications/STM32CubeIDE.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.externaltools.gnu-tools-for-stm32.13.3.rel1.macos64_1.0.100.202509120712/tools/bin:$PATH"
hash -r
```
7.	Next step is to open STMCubeIDE and open existing project in directory
stm-model-zoo-services -> application_code -> image_classification -> STM32N6
8.	In STM Cube IDE navigate to project and run it with Run button. After building and compiling, the image from the camera will be available on the display.

## TRAINING TUTORIAL
<a id="training-tutorial"></a>
### 🗂Dataset Structure
Your dataset must follow this structure:
```
vehicle-10/
	dimonds/
		img1.jpg
		img2.jpg
	sapdes/
	hearts/
	clubs/
```

All lables that are mentined in the dataset should be represented in .txt file in directory:
```
stm32ai-modelzoo-services/
  image_classification/
    datasets/
      labels_name.txt
```
## ⚙ Training Configuration (YAML)
<a id="training-configuration-yaml"></a>
The training_config.yaml is located in:
```
stm32ai-modelzoo-services/
  image_classification/
    config_file_examples/
      training_config.yaml
```
Here is example configuration to train it with playing cards dataset installed from the internet
Model -> all available models to be selected are in [models](/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/image_classification/tf/src/models) folder. One of the availble options is custom_model.
input_shape -> requires size of input image and color mode like 3 - rgb, 1 - greyscale (be careful to keep the same data during all configuration files, unless your project will not work without any errors during compiling. Even order in class_names could lead to unexpected behaviour).

```
After some time your model will be trained and saved into ./tf/src/experiments_outputs/ directory with all logs and visualized training results and matrixes

## ⚙ Quantization Configuration (YAML)
<a id="quantization-configuration-yaml"></a>
More detailed information is provided in [README_QUANTIZATION.md](/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/image_classification/docs/README_QUANTIZATION.md). In case of using guide to generate custom model, please refer to developers tutorial, which contains more detailed information about cutomization each parameter. As a result, you will get a working trained model.
Example content of YAML configuration file 
```yaml
model:
   model_path: /Users/maksym.solovianchyk/Documents/Graduation_Internship/radar_ai_detector/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/image_classification/tf/src/experiments_outputs/2026_04_08_14_56_03/saved_models/best_model.keras 
operation_mode: quantization

dataset:
  dataset_name: custom_dataset
  class_names: [clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades]
  quantization_path: /Users/maksym.solovianchyk/Downloads/archive/cards

preprocessing:
   rescaling:
      scale: 1/127.5
      offset: 0
   resizing:
      aspect_ratio: fit
      interpolation: nearest
   color_mode: rgb

quantization:
   quantizer: TFlite_converter
   quantization_type: PTQ
   quantization_input_type: uint8
   quantization_output_type: int8
   export_dir: quantized_models

mlflow:
   uri: ./tf/src/experiments_outputs/mlruns

hydra:
   run:
      dir: ./tf/src/experiments_outputs/${now:%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S}
```
Run Quantization
To launch your model quantization using a real dataset, run the following command from the UC folder:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name quantization_config.yaml
```
The quantized TensorFlow Lite model can be found in the corresponding **experiments_outputs/** folder.



In case you want to evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model, you can either launch the evaluation operation mode on the generated quantized model (please refer to the evaluation **[readme](./README_EVALUATION.md)** that describes in detail how to proceed) or you can use chained services like launching the [chain_eqe](../config_file_examples/chain_eqe_config.yaml) example with the command below:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name chain_eqe_config.yaml
```

In case you want to evaluate your quantized model footprints, you can either launch the benchmark operation mode on the generated quantized model (please refer to the benchmarking **[readme](./README_BENCHMARKING.md)** that describes in detail how to proceed) or you can use chained services like launching the [chain_qb](../config_file_examples/chain_qb_config.yaml) example with the command below:

```bash
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path ./config_file_examples/ --config-name chain_qb_config.yaml
```
Chained services work whether you specify a quantization dataset or not (random quantization).

## ⚙ Troubleshooting
<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
During quantization or training, many problems may occur due to incorrect settings, that are not supported by pre-trained model. To check requirements go to [image_classification repository](/stm32ai-modelzoo/image_classification). 
Solution: generate a custom model by using a [custom model py](/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/image_classification/tf/src/models/custom_model.py). Here you apply all customized settings and then use it in the training configuration file.
